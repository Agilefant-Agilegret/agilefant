
<p>Development Portfolio is an experimental feature. By enabling the feature, a new 'Portfolio' tab becomes
availabe. In the new tab you see an overview of all your ongoing projects. You can assign a rank to your projects,
but it has no effect on the other system. The possibility of project ranking is only for you to clear your thoughts
on strategic decisions.</p>
