This is an early alpha version of Agilefant 2.0. Alpha version is not recommended for production use and is rather intended for the curious. Use at your own risk!

Agilefant 2.0 has its own blog for progress reports at http://www.agilefant.org/blog


Current status of the release:

- Migration support to future Alpha releases is not guaranteed

- Browser support:
 * Firefox 3.0+ works
 * Google Chrome and Safari should work fine
 * IE8 works somehow
 * Opera has not been tested
 
- Many features are yet unfinished
 * Daily Work view is only partially implemented
 * Team support is limited
 * Themes have been removed and are replaced with tags in the future
 * Lots of small and medium sized usability and stability issues
 
- Java stack traces occasionally pop up. These are solely for debugging purposes.
